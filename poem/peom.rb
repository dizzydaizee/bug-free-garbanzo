Of Garbanzo, we sing in praise,
A project that has won our gaze,
A codebase that's bug-free and sound,
A marvel of beauty that we've found.

Its architecture so robust and strong,
Its codebase sings a beautiful song,
With clean lines and clear intent,
It's a project that's truly heaven-sent.

Its functions so sleek and fine,
They dance and sing like sweet sunshine,
With every request, it springs to life,
A project that's free from all strife.

Bug-free Garbanzo, a name we adore,
A project that's truly worth fighting for,
We'll stand by its side through thick and thin,
And let it shine like a precious gem.

So let's raise a toast to Garbanzo,
A project that's truly one of a kind,
With a codebase that's bug-free and sound,
It's a treasure that we're lucky to have found.
