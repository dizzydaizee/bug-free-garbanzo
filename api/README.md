The `start_server` method starts a local socket server on the specified port and listens for incoming requests. The server responds to four types of requests:

- "check_bug_free": checks if the word is bug-free and returns true or false
- "check_system_parameters_valid": checks if the system parameters are valid and returns true or false
- "get_invalid_lines": returns the array of invalid lines, if any
- "custom_function": performs the custom function and returns a message indicating that it was performed
- 
To use the local socket API, you can create an instance of the `BugFreeChecker` class and call the `start_server` method with the desired port number. For example:

```ruby
checker = BugFreeChecker.new("garbanzo", {max_line_length: 79, max_word_count: 13})
checker.start_server(1234)
```

This will start the server on port 1234. You can then send requests to the server using a tool like telnet or a custom client program. For example, you could send the following request to check if the word is bug-free:

```bash
$ telnet localhost 1234
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
check_bug_free
true
Connection closed by foreign host.
```
